o Anything else you feel is relevant 
Our project is targeted towards people who want to be fashionable, but are not necessarily confident in their ablity to put together outfits that "slay". This project intends to help these users by looking at a user-inputted picture of a clothing article and determines if the outfit is compatible. The user will take pictures of individual articles of clothing and the program will detect whether the colors are aesthetically complementary, letting the user know if so/not.
