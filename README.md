 This program is meant to promt the user to imput six P3 ppm files that correspomd to an outfit, each file will be a component of the outfit (for example, one file is the hat, one the shirt ecc..). The program will then process each of them, reafs the rgb values of each pixell ans find an average. There is a range for each rgb value that correspnd to a color, so for each image the dominant color will be found. The color compatabilty of each component is then checked. The program will finally inform the user wether the outfit created is compatible or not, if it's not the user will know that it's better to change the outfit. To make this program easilly accessible by the user using a desktop app.
